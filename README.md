** How to Play **

Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, move your player across the path to the water and collect the star.  Avoid contact with the bugs, if you don't, you'll lose a turn.

You cannot go over the rock, you must go around it.  Bug and gems will bounce off the rock, changing direction.

Collect gems to increase your number of turns.  Max number of turns stored is five.

Game is over when your turns reaches 0.

The menu icon will open an options menu where you can change your avatar and the game difficulty.


**  Notes  **

Gems are generated randomly.  Every time a bug exits the grid there is a 10% chance a gem will be generated.  Once generated, a gem will stay in play until collected or until the game is over.  Only one gem at a time will be in play.
